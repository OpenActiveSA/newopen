# 🐛 Bug Fix Summary - Login Internal Server Error

## ❌ **The Problem:**

When trying to login, you got an **"Internal server error"** message.

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**

The backend code was written for **PostgreSQL** but the system was configured for **MySQL**. The main issues were:

1. **SQL Placeholder Syntax Mismatch**:
   - PostgreSQL uses: `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc.
   - MySQL uses: `?` for all placeholders

2. **Missing API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/users/me` endpoint was not defined in `backend/routes/users.js`
   - `/api/users/me/clubs` endpoint was not defined

## ✅ **What Was Fixed:**

### 1. **backend/middleware/auth.js**
- ✅ Changed `$1` → `?` in user lookup query
- ✅ Changed `$1, $2` → `?, ?` in club relationship queries
- ✅ Added `userId` property to `req.user` object for consistency

### 2. **backend/routes/users.js**
- ✅ Added `GET /api/users/me` endpoint to get current user profile
- ✅ Added `GET /api/users/me/clubs` endpoint to get user's club relationships
- ✅ Changed all PostgreSQL placeholders to MySQL format

### 3. **backend/routes/auth.js**
- ✅ Changed all `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, `$4` → `?` throughout the file

### 4. **backend/routes/bookings.js**
- ✅ Changed all PostgreSQL placeholders to MySQL format

### 5. **backend/routes/courts.js**
- ✅ Changed all PostgreSQL placeholders to MySQL format

### 6. **backend/routes/clubs.js**
- ✅ Changed all PostgreSQL placeholders to MySQL format

## 🚀 **What Changed:**

### Before (PostgreSQL syntax):
```javascript
const result = await query(
  'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1',
  [userId]
);
```

### After (MySQL syntax):
```javascript
const result = await query(
  'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?',
  [userId]
);
```

## ✅ **Backend Restarted:**

The backend server has been restarted with all the fixes applied.

## 🎯 **Try Login Again:**

1. **Go to**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Click**: Menu (☰) → Login
3. **Enter**:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`
4. **Click**: Login

**It should work now!** ✨

## 📝 **Technical Notes:**

The project was initially set up with Supabase/PostgreSQL in mind (as seen in `database/schema.sql`), but was later switched to MySQL (Laragon setup). This created a database syntax mismatch that caused runtime errors.

**Solution**: Created `database/schema-mysql.sql` with MySQL-compatible schema and updated all backend routes to use MySQL parameter syntax.
